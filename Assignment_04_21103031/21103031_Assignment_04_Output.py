Enter dividend (positive integer) : 20
Enter divisor (positive integer) : 16
The quotient is : 1
The remainder is : 4

a. Checking whether function/values is callable or not.
Check the source code to see which value and function is used in callable method.
False
True

b. Checking whether all the values are non zeros or not
The previous output is : {1: 'Quotient', 4: 'Remainder'}
The output is : True
The quotient and remainder are non zero values.

c. Adding values (4, 5, 6) to the result and filtering out the values which are greater than 4.
The required filtered values in list form is : [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

d. Converting the above list into set datatype.
The required output is : {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}

e. Making above set immutable.
The immutable set is : frozenset({5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10})

f. Finding maximum value from set and its hash value.
(1) The maximum value from the set is : 10
(2.a) The hash value of 10 is: 10
(2.b) The hash value of frozenset({5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}) is: 2627905469991904590
